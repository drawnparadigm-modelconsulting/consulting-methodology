# Case Study: Predictive Revenue Modeling
**Client Sector:** [e.g., Retail / SaaS / Logistics]
**Duration:** 4 Weeks

## 🚩 The Challenge
The client was experiencing 15% variance in monthly revenue forecasting, leading to inventory surpluses and missed scaling opportunities.

## 🛠️ The Solution
Using the **Drawn Paradigm Framework**, I audited their existing data pipeline and identified two primary "leakage" points in their logic:
1. **Inconsistent Lead Attribution:** Revenue was being tagged to the wrong channels.
2. **Seasonal Lag:** The model didn't account for 14-day trailing market shifts.

## 📈 The Result
* **Accuracy:** Improved forecasting precision by 22%.
* **Impact:** Reduced unnecessary inventory overhead by $12k/month.
* **Scalability:** The new model logic was automated using the `logic.py` framework found in this repository.
