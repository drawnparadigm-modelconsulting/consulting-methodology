# Strategic Modeling Framework
## by Drawn Paradigm

This repository outlines the foundational frameworks used to assess, audit, and optimize business models.

### 🔍 Phase 1: Discovery & Data Auditing
- Reviewing existing data architecture.
- Identifying gaps in current reporting logic.
- Establishing KPIs that align with stakeholder goals.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: Model Architecture
We focus on building models that are:
1. **Scalable:** Able to handle increasing data volume.
2. **Transparent:** No "black boxes"—logic is documented and auditable.
3. **Actionable:** Results drive specific business decisions.

### 📈 Phase 3: Implementation & Monitoring
- Stress-testing models against market volatility.
- Continuous feedback loops for accuracy refinement.
