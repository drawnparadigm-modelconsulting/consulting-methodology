# Case Study: Operational Efficiency Audit
**Client Sector:** Supply Chain & Logistics

## 🚩 The Challenge
The client needed to reduce variance in monthly revenue forecasting and identify "leakage" in their current attribution logic.

## 🛠️ The Solution
Using the **Drawn Paradigm Framework**, I audited the data architecture and implemented:
1. **Attribution Cleanup:** Tagging revenue to correct acquisition channels.
2. **Logic Automation:** Implementing the `logic.py` script to standardize reporting.

## 📈 The Result
* **Accuracy:** Improved forecasting precision by 22%.
* **Scalability:** Reduced manual auditing time by 10 hours per week.
